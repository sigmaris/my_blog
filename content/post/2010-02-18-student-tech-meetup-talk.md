On Wednesday, I gave a talk at the Student Techmeetup here in Edinburgh on DS homebrew development. As promised, I&#8217;ve uploaded the slides from that talk as a PDF <a title="DS Homebrew presentation" href="/files/dspreso.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, with links to a few tutorials and resources included in them, along with some notes.
