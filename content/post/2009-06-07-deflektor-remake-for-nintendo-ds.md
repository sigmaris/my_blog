Here is a project I&#8217;ve been working on for a few weeks to learn more about DS homebrew coding. It&#8217;s a remake of Deflektor, an old puzzle game that I played on the Amiga. I&#8217;ve tried to keep the retro feel of the original while updating it to use the touchscreen interface.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37" title="ss2" src="/blog/uploads/2009/06/ss2.png" alt="ss2" width="186" height="278" srcset="/blog/uploads/2009/06/ss2.png 259w, /blog/uploads/2009/06/ss2-201x300.png 201w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36" title="ss1" src="/blog/uploads/2009/06/ss1.png" alt="ss1" width="185" height="278" srcset="/blog/uploads/2009/06/ss1.png 257w, /blog/uploads/2009/06/ss1-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 185px) 100vw, 185px" />

The aim is to rotate the mirrors (<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24" title="mirror" src="/blog/uploads/2009/06/mirror.png" alt="mirror" width="16" height="16" />) to reflect the laser beam from the source (<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26" title="source" src="/blog/uploads/2009/06/source.png" alt="source" width="16" height="16" />) to blow up all the triggers (<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-30" title="trigger" src="/blog/uploads/2009/06/trigger.png" alt="trigger" width="16" height="14" />) and then enter the target (<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-28" title="target" src="/blog/uploads/2009/06/target.png" alt="target" width="16" height="16" />). Rotate the mirrors by tapping on them and then dragging to align the mirror at a particular angle. You start with an amount of energy which is constantly declining (the green bar). Directing the beam into a spike (<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27" title="spike" src="/blog/uploads/2009/06/spike.png" alt="spike" width="16" height="13" />) or reflecting the beam back to the source will cause it to overload (represented by the red bar). If the source is overloaded too much or if you run out of energy, you lose a life. There are also rotating blocks which only allow the beam to pass at a certain angle (<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23" title="angleblocker" src="/blog/uploads/2009/06/angleblocker.png" alt="angleblocker" width="16" height="16" />), teleports (<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29" title="teleport" src="/blog/uploads/2009/06/teleport.png" alt="teleport" width="16" height="16" />) which work in pairs, and blocks which randomize the beam direction (<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25" title="random" src="/blog/uploads/2009/06/random.png" alt="random" width="16" height="16" />). In addition, in some levels there are gremlins which roam about the board and mess with your stuff. You can get rid of them by tapping on them repeatedly.

There are a few things I&#8217;d like to add to the game, like highscore saving and a level editor, which might appear if I have time to work on it. For now it comes with all the levels from the original game. You can download it [here][1]. Any comments, bug reports, etc are welcome!
