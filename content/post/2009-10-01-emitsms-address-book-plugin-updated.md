The emitSMS plugin for Address Book has been updated to use native Mac OS methods to access the phone over Bluetooth, rather than using an emulated serial port. This should make it less flaky when used under Snow Leopard. You can get the updated plugin [here][1], and the new source code is <a title="emitSMS address book plugin source" href="https://github.com/sigmaris/AddressBookSMS" target="_blank">here</a>.
